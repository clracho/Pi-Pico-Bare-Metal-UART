# Pi-Pico-Bare-Metal-UART

Created for a university project. When two Raspberry Pi Picos are programmed with this program, they can send commands via a duplex interrupt-based UART interface.

Requires development environment [found here](https://github.com/dougsummerville/Bare-Metal-Raspberry-PI-Pico) for dependencies, building, and programming to target.
